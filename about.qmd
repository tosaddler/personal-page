I am currently a [data scientist](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/ptb/staff/index.cfm) in the [Toxicoinformatics Group](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/ptb/toxico/index.cfm) of the [Predictive Toxicology Branch](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/ptb/index.cfm) in the [Division of Translational Toxicology](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/dtt/index.cfm) at [NIEHS](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/index.cfm) (whew...).

I made a YouTube video about Cytoscape that got a lot of views and I would like to get back to making more videos. I have written a few articles a while ago, and have been on some scientific publications.
