## Why Quarto?

I profess my love for Quarto at every opportunity. Here are some reasons why I think Quarto is great:

- Quarto is [open source](https://quarto.org/license.html) with a GPL-2 license.
- Multiple [output formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html) in a single project
  - All of the built in [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, MS Word, Revealjs, ePub, etc.)
- Works with R, Python, Shiny
