I was trying to recreate a template that we use at DTT, and I had previously resorted to some other hacky ways of getting slide headers.\nI decided enough was enough, and I spent the time to figure out how to apply a header (or any other element I suppose) globally to every slide… except for the title slide.\n\nQuarto\nFor those reading who aren’t familiar with Quarto, it is a scientific publishing platform that renders a variety of outputs. One of the features that I’ve been playing with the most is reveal.js presentations.\n\n\nreveal.js\nreveal.js has its own native syntax, but using Quarto as a wrapper allows me to tap into the rest of the output ecosystem of Quarto."
